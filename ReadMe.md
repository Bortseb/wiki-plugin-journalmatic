# Journal Tools

A collection of frame plugin based tools that can be used to check for, and resolving problems that might arise with a page's journal.

The current tools include:
* Scanning the origin wiki for pages that have problems.
* Scanning an single wiki page for problems.
* An initial tool to compress a page's journal - this will condense edit actions that occur within a short while of each other.

## To Do:

Not in any particular order:

* [ ] Finalise the page names, and content.
* [ ] Add some reporting of the causes of a revision error.
* [ ] Add a second compression tool that reduces journal size to a greater ammount.
